## Unreleased

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* The `cluster_desired_capacity` is now ignored after the first `apply` of the
  module since, in the case of autoscaling or manual scaling, the value may have
  changed between `apply`s.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* A `cluster_instance_metadata_options` variable has been added which mirrors
  the [metadata_options](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/launch_template#metadata-options)
  exposed on the `aws_launch_template` resource. Among other things, this allows
  users of this module to require that IMDSv2 be used by containers in the 
  cluster. By default, IMDSv2 is not required in this version of the module but
  a future major release of the module may enforce IMDSv2 usage.
* The EBS volumes attached to container instances are now tagged with
  `Component`, `DeploymentIdentifier`, `Name` and `ClusterName` tags by default,
  as well as with any tags passed in the `tags` var when provided (resolves 
  #94).

## 6.0.0 (February 22th 2023)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* This module is now compatible with Terraform 1.1 and higher.
* This module now uses EBS volume encryption by default. This can be disabled
  using `cluster_instance_enable_ebs_volume_encryption = false`.
* In line with Amazon's update of the default root block storage device, the 
  default in this module is now `/dev/xvda`.
* All variables previously using `"yes|no"` have been replaced with
  `true|false`.
* The `allowed_cidrs` variable has been renamed to `default_ingress_cidrs`.
* The `egress_cidrs` variable has been renamed to `default_egress_cidrs`.
* The `cluster_instance_amis` variable has been replaced with the singular
  `cluster_instance_ami`, with default value of `null`.
* The following variables have had their default value replaced from `""` to
  `null`:
  - `cluster_instance_user_data_template`
  - `cluster_instance_iam_policy_contents`
  - `cluster_service_iam_policy_contents`

IMPROVEMENTS:

* This module now uses the nullable feature to simplify variable defaults.

## 5.0.1 (February 2nd 2023)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* added option to specify log retention period for cluster
* added option to disable enhanced instance monitoring (enabled by default)
* added option to specify the path of the root block storage device as AWS
  default has changed from `/dev/sda1` to `/dev/xvda`

## 5.0.0 (December 22nd 2022)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* This module is now compatible with Terraform 1.0 and higher.
* In line with Amazon's deprecation and pending removal of support for launch
  configurations, this module now creates a launch template for the autoscaling
  group. As a result, the `launch_configuration_name` output has been replaced
  by the `launch_template_name` and `launch_template_id` outputs. Upon upgrading
  this module, the launch configuration will be destroyed and an equivalent
  launch template will be created and associated with the autoscaling group.
* The unused `launch_configuration_create_before_destroy` variable has been
  removed.

## 4.2.0 (June 20th 2022)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* The `aws` and `null` provider constraints have been loosened to allow this
  module to be used with the latest versions of each. This enables use of
  Terraform AWS provider v4.
* The no longer supported `template` provider has been replaced with native
  terraform configuration language equivalents.

## 4.1.0 (March 19th 2022)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* The `aws_ecs_cluster_capacity_providers` resource is now used to associate
  capacity providers with the created ECS cluster.

## 4.0.0 (May 27th, 2021)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* This module is now compatible with Terraform 0.14 and higher.

## 0.2.6 (December 31st, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* The `associate_public_ip_addresses` variable allows public IPs to be
  associated to ECS container instances. By default its value is `no`.

## 0.2.5 (December 31st, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Updated README with correct inputs, outputs and usage.

## 0.2.4 (December 30th, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* The cluster now uses the latest ECS optimised amazon linux image by default.
  This can be overridden using the `cluster_instance_amis` variable.
* The `private_subnet_ids` variable has been renamed to `subnet_ids` as there
  is nothing requiring the subnets to be private
* The `private_network_cidr` variable has been renamed to `allowed_cidrs` and
  its type has changed to list.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* The cluster now uses the latest ECS optimised amazon linux image by default.
* The default security group ingress and egress rules are now optional and
  configurable. A list of CIDRs for both ingress and egress can be specified
  using `allowed_cidrs` and `egress_cidrs` respectively. The default rules
  can be disabled using `include_default_ingress_rule` and
  `include_default_egress_rule`.
* The security group ID is now available via an output named
  `security_group_id` so that additional rules can be added outside of the
  module.

## 0.2.3 (December 29th, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* The configuration directory has changed from `<repo>/src` to `<repo>` to
  satisfy the Terraform standard module structure.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* All variables and outputs now have descriptions to satisfy the Terraform
  standard module structure.

## 0.2.0 (November 3th, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* The IAM roles and policies for instance and service now use randomly
  generated names. The value that was previously used for name can now be found
  in the description.
